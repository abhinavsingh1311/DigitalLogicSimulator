# DigitalLogicSimulator
This is a comprehensive digital logic simulator that follows COMP ARCH by M.Morris Mano.

## Project Description
 This is a simple logic simulator project that simulates the logic of a digital circuit. The project is built using the C++ programming language.The project follows the COMP ARCH by Morris textbook (CH-1). 

- The project is a part of learn as you build series and it is a part of my personal project. 
- It covers digital logic gates, truth tables, and Boolean algebra. 
- It also visualises k-maps simplification process.
- It also builds on combinational and sequential circuits.

## Features:
- The four major components of the project are: 
 - logic engine (core)
 - boolean processor
 - k-map solver
 - user interface

## Project components:

 ### 1. Logic Engine (core)
  - This is the core of the project. It is responsible for simulating the logic of a digital circuit.
  - It is built using the C++ programming language.
  - It uses a data structure to represent the simulation state.
  - It handles signal propagation and timing.
  - It is responsible for the overall architecture of the simulator.
  - It is the most important component of the project.

  ### 2. Boolean Processor
  - This component is responsible for processing Boolean expressions.
  - It uses the logic engine to simulate the logic of a digital circuit.
  - It is built using the C++ programming language.
  - It uses a data structure to represent the Boolean expression.
  - It handles the simplification of Boolean expressions.
  - It is responsible for the Boolean algebra part of the project.

  ### 3. K-Map Solver
  - This component is responsible for solving k-maps.
  - It uses the logic engine to simulate the logic of a digital circuit.
  - It is built using the C++ programming language.
  - It uses a data structure to represent the k-map.
  - It handles the simplification of k-maps.
  - It is responsible for the k-map simplification part of the project.

  ### 4. User Interface
  - This component is responsible for providing a user interface for the simulator.
  - It is built using the C++ programming language.
  - It uses a data structure to represent the user interface.
  - It handles user input and output.
  - It is responsible for the user interaction part of the project.

## Usage:
- The project can be used to understand the working of the digital logic.

## Credits:
- As stated in the project description, this project is a part of learn as you build series and it is a part of my personal project. I have referenced the COMP ARCH by Morris textbook (CH-1) for the project.
