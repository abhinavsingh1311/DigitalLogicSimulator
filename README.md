# DigitalLogicSimulator
This is a comprehensive digital logic simulator that follows COMP ARCH by M.Morris Mano.

## Project Description
 This is a simple logic simulator project that simulates the logic of a digital circuit. The project is built using the C++ programming language.The project follows the COMP ARCH by Morris textbook (CH-1). 

- The project is a part of learn as you build series and it is a part of my personal project. 
- It covers digital logic gates, truth tables, and Boolean algebra. 
- It also visualises k-maps simplification process.
- It also builds on combinational and sequential circuits.

## Features:
- The four major components of the project are: 
 - logic engine (core)
 - boolean processor
 - k-map solver
 - user interface

## Project components:

 ### 1. Logic Engine (core)
  - This is the core of the project. It is responsible for simulating the logic of a digital circuit.

  ### 2. Boolean Processor
  - This component is responsible for processing Boolean expressions.
  - It uses the logic engine to simulate the logic of a digital circuit.


  ### 3. K-Map Solver
  - This component is responsible for solving k-maps.
  - It uses the logic engine to simulate the logic of a digital circuit.


  ### 4. User Interface
  - This component is responsible for providing a user interface for the simulator.
  

## Project Devlopment: 
- The project is set to be completed in 4 phases.
- Phase 1: Foundation (Basic Gates)
  - Gate.h - The base gate class header file.
  - Gate.cpp - The base gate class implementation file.
  - BasicGates.h - The header file for the basic gates.
  - BasicGates.cpp - The implementation file for the bas gates.s
  - GateFactory.h - Gate creation utilities.
  - TruthTable.h - Truth Table generation
  - TruthTable.cpp - Truth Table logic
  - main.cpp - The main driver file.

## Usage:
- The project can be used to understand the working of the digital logic.

## Credits:
- As stated in the project description, this project is a part of learn as you build series and it is a part of my personal project. I have referenced the COMP ARCH by Morris textbook (CH-1) for the project.
